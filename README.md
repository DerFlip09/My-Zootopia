## About the Project
The project is one of many i did in my programming journey at Masterschool. It showed me the power of APIs
and how to structure code with good architecture. 

## Built with

To use my program you need to set up your environment:

Also you need Git (Windows) or the Git Credential Manager, to clone the repo

Contributions are always welcomed! If you want to contribute here are some guidelines to follow:
    - create a contribution file with your github name so i can thank you or make requests about your code
    - in the file give me feedback or code samples to help me get better and make my program better
